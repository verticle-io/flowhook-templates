# flowhook-templates
Mapping templates for Flowhook

This repository collects ready-to-use mappings for various webhooks of 3rdparty services which payloads are valuable for Grafana users.

The mappings of this repo are selectable in the Flowhook UI at https://flowhook.herokuapp.com and help users to faster ramp up their setups.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute a mapping - and thus get it directly listed in the tool - please use the `mapping.yaml.template` for starting and create a PR for it.
We will review the mapping and add it to the repo.
